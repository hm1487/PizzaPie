# PizzaPie
A neural network machine learning algorithm that will determine whether or not an image has pizza or not

MachineLearningPizza is the deep network I tried to write on my own, and made some progress, but the epochs would not begin

MachineLearningPizza.2 is the deep network that I downloaded and works. Borrowed heavily from the github.

The RenameFileScript renames the files so that they're all named pizza, then with a corresponding number, and then resized accordingly, because not all of the photos were the same size. 

Pizza images are provided via imagenet, and pictures of students were all taken by me


I hope to actually develop my own network fully. 

All work
